Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was made to help understand American voters better, like their backgrounds and political views. There wasn't a ready dataset available with detailed info on US voters, so this one was put together to fill that gap.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was put together by a team at a private company that works with data, especially about politics and voters.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The company itself paid for making this dataset; there wasn't any outside funding or grants involved.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - TBD

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The instances in the dataset represent individual voters in the United States, each with associated demographic and political attributes.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- The total number of instances in the dataset is approximately 150 million, each representing a unique voter record.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a sample of voter records from a larger set, namely a US voter file record from a private company. This sample was chosen to be representative of the larger set by training a model on the 2020 US Cooperative Election Study and post-stratifying it, on an individual basis, based on the voter file.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance consists of various features such as demographic information (age, gender, income), geographic location, and etc.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset may include a target label indicating the voter's political affiliation or voting behavior.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some instances may have missing data due to various reasons such as incomplete voter records or data collection errors.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- The dataset may include implicit relationships between individual voters, such as interactions within social networks or affiliations with specific political groups.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- No
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- It is self-contained
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes. US voter file record data is confidential.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- Yes. US voter file record is data for a person with regards to their age, gender, resident, etc.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- Yes. As stated the dataset contains information about individual's voting record, age, gender, and etc. 
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes. Political information can be identified. 
16. *Any other comments?*
	- NA

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- The data about each voter is provided from a company's voter list. Then, we used a study from 2020 about US elections to make our data better. We checked and corrected the information about each voter to make sure it was accurate.
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- We used computer programs to collect and organize the voter data from the company's list and the 2020 election study. We tested these programs to make sure they worked correctly.
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- We took a sample of voters from the bigger voter list. We used a method that gave each voter in the list a chance to be chosen for the sample. This way, our sample represents different kinds of voters.
4. *Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?*
	- Our team of data experts collected the voter information. They are employees of our company and were paid according to company rules.
5. *Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (for example, recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.*
	- We collected the voter data around the time of the 2020 US presidential election. This matches the time when the voter information was relevant and up-to-date.
6. *Were any ethical review processes conducted (for example, by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- No
